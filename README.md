Netflex 🎬  
Welcome to Netflex — a movie web app I built to showcase my front-end development skills. Visitors can browse movies, search for their favorites, and save them to a personal favorites list.

🚀 Features  
• 🔎 Search Movies: Instantly find movies using the TMDB API.  
• 📃 Movie Listings: Browse through a wide range of movies.  
• ❤️ Favorites: Add movies to your favorites list for quick access.  
• 💻 Responsive Design: Works seamlessly across all devices.  


  
🛠️ Technologies Used  
• ReactJS: Front-end library to build a dynamic, component-based interface.  
• CSS: Hand-coded styling with a focus on Flexbox and CSS Grid layouts (no frameworks used).  
• TMDB API: Fetches up-to-date movie data.  
  

🎨 Why This Project?  
I created Netflex to highlight my proficiency in React and CSS. By avoiding styling frameworks, I challenged myself to craft responsive and aesthetic layouts purely with CSS.
